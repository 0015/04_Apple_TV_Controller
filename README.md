 *Unity Asset*

It allows you to make a test for remote controller action between your project and AppleTV. All you need is adding "joystick button 0" and "joystick button 15" to get the menu button and Play and Pause button in Input, Project setting. 

Also, you can see how to move buttons on the GUI panel. 

I hope this one is helpful for your potential project.
